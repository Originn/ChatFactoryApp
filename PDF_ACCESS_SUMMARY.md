# PDF Access Expiration Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Private PDFs had 24-hour expiration, causing concern about access after expiration
- **Solution**: Extended private PDF expiration to 7 days + created configurable system

## ✅ Current Behavior

### Private PDFs (Extended from 24 hours → 7 days)
- **"View PDF" button**: Always works - generates fresh 7-day URLs
- **Direct URL**: Expires after 7 days (if bookmarked/saved)
- **Recommendation**: Use "View PDF" button for reliable access

### Public PDFs (Still 1 year)
- **"View PDF" button**: Always works - generates fresh 1-year URLs
- **Direct URL**: Expires after 1 year (if bookmarked/saved)

## 📋 Files Updated
1. `src/config/pdfAccess.ts` - New configuration system
2. `src/services/pdfService.ts` - Uses configuration
3. `src/app/api/user-pdfs/[id]/access/route.ts` - Uses configuration
4. `src/app/api/user-pdfs/[id]/privacy/route.ts` - Uses configuration
5. `src/components/dashboard/UserPDFManager.tsx` - Updated tooltip

## 🔧 Configuration Options
- **Public**: 1 year (365 days)
- **Private**: 7 days (168 hours)
- **Chatbot**: 30 days (for future use)
- **Admin**: 90 days (for future use)

## 🚀 Future Flexibility
The new configuration system allows easy adjustment of expiration times in `src/config/pdfAccess.ts` without changing multiple files.

## 📝 Note About "Not Public" Status
The "Not public" status in Google Cloud Console is **expected behavior** with uniform bucket-level access. Your PDFs are still accessible through the app's signed URLs.

## 🎉 Result
- No more expiration concerns for private PDFs
- Better user experience with 7-day access
- Configurable system for future needs
- Full compatibility with uniform bucket-level access
